# Basic React Starter

## Poi
Built using the excellent [Poi](https://poi.js.org). IMHO the best no-config development kit.
Now you can forget or even be ignorant about webpack. ðŸ˜œ
Deal with it. ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage
1.	I implore you to use yarn instead of npm. It's faster. Will save you hours.

	On Mac:
	```shell
	brew install yarn
	```
	Other platforms:
